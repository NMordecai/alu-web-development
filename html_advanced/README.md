Think of HTML as the essential structure of your website â€“ the content, the headings, the paragraphs, the links. It's the skeleton that gives your page meaning and organisation. By using tags like <header>, <main>, <article>, and <footer>, you're building a clear and logical framework for your content, making it understandable for browsers and accessible to everyone."
